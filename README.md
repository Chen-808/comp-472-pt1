# COMP 472 - Mini Project 1

## Getting Started

Tested on Python version: 3.8.13

Here is how I set up my environment and install dependencies. Feel free to use another approach, such as using Anaconda.

- Create a virtual environment.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
- Check out `notebook.ipynb`!
